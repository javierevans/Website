      <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
           Hey! I’m Javier Evans, a computer science student based in New Jersey.
            I enjoy building practical websites and applications that solve real-world
            problems for myself, my family, and my community.
        </p>

          <p>
            I’m especially interested in web development, machine learning, and robotics —
            exploring how software can power intelligent systems and interact with the real world.
          </p>

            <p>
              I’m driven by curiosity and continuous improvement, always learning new technologies
                and pushing myself to become a more capable and well-rounded engineer.
          </p>
